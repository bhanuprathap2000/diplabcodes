## Abstract
AND CONCLUSIONS
Organizations such as governments, companies, and the military involve many professionals, but can have goals independent of human needs. Because of the role computer technology now plays in any large project, computer professionals may face ethical decisions between organizational interests and social values. Unfortunately, if there are vested job interests, the reliance on higher authority, regular routines, and technological curiosity may support amoral rationality: do a good job technically, but leave responsibility to the larger organization. Because of this process, professionals have been participants in collective violence.

## Key points
- It is the intention of the Journal of Systems and Software to publish, from time to time, articles cut from a different mold
- Professions in contemporary society can be characterized by four defining features: they possess specialized knowledge; they are important to society; they enjoy a high degree of autonomy and self-regulation; and they are guided by an ideology of public service [I]
- WHY DESTRUCTIVE PROFESSIONAL WORK OCCURS: A PREDICTIVE MODEL. These mechanisms can result in a situation where many highly-trained people work on projects that have very large human costs
- Social and temporal traps provide a useful framework for evaluating the role of individuals in collective violence
- Lawful predictions can be made for both rational and shortsighted behavior. This approach has the advantage of applying to individuals at all levels of organizational hierarchies, and in many different situations

## Synopsis

### SYSTEMS SOFTWARE
It is the intention of the Journal of Systems and Software to publish, from time to time, articles cut from a different mold.
The object of the Controversy Corner articles is not so much to present info~ation as to stimulate thought
Topics chosen for this coverage are not traditional formal discussions of research work, but rather are informal presentations of key issues in the systems and software world.
This series will succeed only to the extent that it stimulates not just thought, but action.

### INTRODUCTION
Professions in contemporary society can be characterized by four defining features: they possess specialized knowledge; they are important to society; they enjoy a high degree of autonomy and self-regulation; and they are guided by an ideology of public service [I].
One analyst of genocidal violence estimates that more than 100,000,000 people have been killed by governments during the twentieth century [^3]
Another scholar counted 22 wars underway in 1987-more than in any other single year in human history [^4].
The work done by computer professionals in South Africa has even more direct consequences for human welfare
As this is being written, ordinary people are working conscientiously at keyboards in the banking system, the government, universities, and software companies, all upholding the Apartheid regime.

### SYSTEMS SOFTWARE
Technological curiosity Distancing effects als who have no direct involvement with these or other forms of collective violence should be concerned about the problem, since they and their families are potential victims.
(Note that bureaucracies serve to distance policy makers from front-line effects, and front-line workers from responsibility for policies.)
Taken together, these mechanisms can result in a situation where many highly-trained people work on projects that have very large human costs.
These mechanisms can result in a situation where many highly-trained people work on projects that have very large human costs
Use of mechanisms such as these could be reinforced by socialization and professional training [^30].
The computer professional may be faced with choosing between a profitable but low-probability project, for example, or one which offers less profit but a better chance of success
Another implant parameter in the subjective value of different alternatives is time delay.

### SYSTEMS SOFTWARE
1992; 17:91-103 are both in one’s self-interest and immediate: “travel . . . summer employment . . . interesting people . . . earn extra money . . . build on your career . . . parttime adventure” [^55].
“social” traps, or social dilemmas, apply only to a choice between self-interest and broader social or group interests (e.g., [^59]).
This model has been formally tested in laboratory simulations of conflict and cooperation between individuals and between countries [^60].
“Temporal” traps could be defined, for conflict between an immediate, short-term incentive, and a later one
The significance of these choices is that one has to wait to obtain the preferable alternative.
Which would you rather have: a small but immediate reward or a larger delayed one?

### Small consequence
The psychological literature reviewed suggests that the computer professional tends to maximize short-term gains.
The psychological model and collective effects outlined here suggest that the wheels of the technological machine may be powered more by short-term economic interests and psychological, organizational, and technical mechanisms than by actual scientific or social needs
This can lead to devastating human costs on a world-wide scale.
Effective codes of ethics at both the fundamental and procedural levels serve two complementary purposes
They protect consumers and subgroups of society from institutionalized destructiveness by encouraging professional activities that are in the interests of human welfare.
The various types of ethical guidelines can protect the individual professional who receives instructions to carry out questionable or unconscionable institutional goals [^20]
Employees in this situation can “pass the buck,” deferring responsibility for their inability to serve the company or government agency to an objective, often international code of ethics.
With an early commitment to one choice, both alternatives are long term, and the time delay has less effect than the actual values of the possible outcomes

### SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Organizations such as governments, companies, and the military involve many professionals, but can have goals independent of human needs.
If there are vested job interests, the reliance on higher authority, regular routines, and technological curiosity may support amoral rationality: do a good job technically, but leave responsibility to the larger organization.
Because of this process, professionals have been participants in collective violence.
Social and temporal traps provide a useful framework for evaluating the role of individuals in collective violence.
These models look at the value and timing of the alternatives in a decision.
Professional codes of ethics, education, and government policies may all facilitate choices that provide benefits individually and collectively

### Findings
Note that the two alternatives differ in both probability (0% vs 10%) and value

## Study subjects

### 4 engineering students with summer jobs at Lawrence Livermore
- A diffusion of responsibility tends to occur naturally with complex technology, since technological work relies on numerous different specialists [^35]. ==Therefore, most individuals have only small parts in the ultimate product, for which they do not feel responsible. (There are also situations in which a compa~ment~ized product is benign, but could be developed in future for either beneficial or harmful applications.) Lempert [^27] reports interviews with four engineering students with summer jobs at Lawrence Livermore (nuclear weapons) Labs: “All four seemed to agree that in only a few months one could not possibly make a large enough contribution to feel one had personally helped to develop new nuclear arms” ([^27], p. 63)==. This type of perception then leads to logic of the following sort: “I only ___, I don’t actually use them.”

## Findings
- Note that the two alternatives differ in both probability (0% vs. 10%) and value (profit vs. negative consequences)

##  Builds on previous research
- These have been defined from the few existing case studies [27-291, autobiographies [^30], ethnographies [3 l] and related theoretical works 132-353. ==We have attempted to list mechanisms which are applicable in many different situations==
- In both cases, though, there are immediate, tangible incentives for individuals to contribute to a system in which maximizing their own interests adds to the risk of harm for others later on. The incentives for decisions that ==we are faced with can be defined in terms of a number of interacting parameters, such as the value of different alternatives==, the probability associated with each alternative, and the type of each alternative [^53]
- This in turn has more value than a promise of $10 or more in five weeks. ==Interestingly, we can obtain the relative importance of magnitude and time delay by asking how much money would be equally valuable==: “Would you take $12 tomorrow instead of $10 now?” “ Would you take $30 in five weeks instead of $10 now?” Regardless of the actual value in dollars, the psychological value is thus a nonlinear function of time ([^54])

## Differs from previous work
- Festinger developed a theory explaining how a post hoc shift in attitudes results from “cognitive dissonance” [^40]. When ==we become aware that our actions contradict our values==, we may rearrange our values after the fact to reduce inconsistency
- This view suggests that computer professionals should let society regulate what is acceptable through government representatives. Noting that the government ==cannot always be trusted to provide objective information, however, Sussman [^46] states that our “leaders’ deliberate avoidance of true debate==, the contempt they show the public during political campaigning, their use and re~nement of propaganda techniques, the attentiveness of so many of them to moneyed interests and not to the people generally, are all major causes of resentment and distrust” ([^46], p. 49)
