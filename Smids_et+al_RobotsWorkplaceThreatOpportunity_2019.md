## Abstract
The concept of meaningful work has recently received increased attention in philosophy and other disciplines. However, the impact of the increasing robotization of the workplace on meaningful work has received very little attention so far. Doing work that is meaningful leads to higher job satisfaction and increased worker well-being, and some argue for a right to access to meaningful work. In this paper, we therefore address the impact of robotization on meaningful work. We do so by identifying five key aspects of meaningful work: pursuing a purpose, social relationships, exercising skills and self-development, self-esteem and recognition, and autonomy. For each aspect, we analyze how the introduction of robots into the workplace may diminish or enhance the meaningfulness of work. ==We also identify a few ethical issues that emerge from our analysis==. We conclude that robotization of the workplace can have both significant negative and positive effects on meaningful work. Our findings about ways in which robotization of the workplace can be a threat or opportunity for meaningful work can serve as the basis for ethical arguments for how to—and how not to—implement robots into workplaces.

## Synopsis

### Introduction
Nissa Scott is one of the many workers whose daily work—in her case stacking plastic bins in an Amazon warehouse—has been outsourced to a robot.
For Scott, this did not mean that she had to find a new job
Instead, she oversees the robotic arms stacking the bins, making sure that everything goes well, and intervening in case of trouble.
Robots have begun entering many workplaces: from order-picking robots in warehouses to delivery robots on university campuses and to bomb disposal robots working alongside teams of soldiers (Royakkers and van Est 2015)
This gives us reason to reflect on how to keep work meaningful in the future.
The issue of robots’ effect on meaningful work has not been discussed much
This motivates the general topic of this paper: the paper investigates both ways in which robots in the workplace might pose a threat to meaningful work and ways in which they might make work more meaningful.
We summarize our general claims about the influence of robots on meaningful work in a table (Section 5), briefly discuss ethical issues that may arise (Section 6), and end with some concluding remarks (Section 7)

### What Are Robots and how Do They Enter the Workplace?
Robots are embodied machines equipped with sensors and actuators and some degree of artificial intelligence, typically able to perform tasks associated with particular types of work (Royakkers and van Est 2015).
We can distinguish preprogrammed robots, such as the robots employed in the assembly halls of car manufacturers designed to perform well-described tasks in welldefined and controlled environments.
Examples are exoskeletons by means of which paralyzed persons can walk, or robotic legs or arms
Such robotic skeletons can be used to enable workers—e.g., soldiers—to use heavy gear.
The reasons why companies and organizations are introducing robots into the workplace are straightforward.
They include projected cost savings, increased efficiency, improved outcomes, dealing with insufficient numbers of workers in certain domains, the need to stay innovative, the need to remain an attractive employer, and so on.
Given the clear trend towards more robotization, there is every reason to investigate how the collaboration with robots can result in meaningful work

### What Is Meaningful Work?
Our primary focus is the impact of robots on work in the sense of the performance of a set of tasks in exchange for remuneration, regulated by a contract and relevant social norms (Cf. [^Danaher_2017_a]).
Some political philosophers have recently discussed meaningful work in relation to the above-mentioned question of whether a case can be made for an individual right to meaningful work.
We looked at what the various authors call, for example, dimensions of, pathways to, and sources of meaningful work, and identified those aspects that are most frequently mentioned in both literatures
On this basis, we take it that work is meaningful to the extent that work involves the following:.
A subjectivist theory will hold, based on the convergence in the empirical literature from the field of organizational psychology, that as a matter of fact people will generally experience work as meaningful to the extent that work exhibits the five aspects on our list.
By outlining how robotization can impact these five aspects of meaningful work in a positive or negative way, organizations can gain insights into how they can shape the introduction of robots in the workplace such that work remains meaningful

### Pursuing a Purpose
Purposefulness is typically seen as a key dimension of meaningful lives more generally.
Likewise, pursuing purpose in our work and making a contribution along the way are widely regarded as making work meaningful ([^Grant_2008_a]; [^Martela_2018_b]; [^Rosso_et+al_2010_a]).
Process and outcome, contributes to the meaningfulness of work in a different way.
This is the case even if the achievement of the purposes actively strived for is not yet there, or even not in sight at all, as might be the case for designers working on a tough problem, or psychotherapists seeing no progress yet in the mental health of their clients.
Just as that is a common association about meaningfulness more generally, it is a common idea about meaningful work

### Social Relationships
Like purposiveness, having good social relationships contributes both to a meaningful life as a whole and to meaningful work .
Social relationships provide people with a sense of belonging and relatedness
Feeling accepted and cared for by colleagues, cooperating in a positive way, and being mentored or otherwise supported all lead workers to find their work more meaningful ([^Madden_2016_a]; [^Martela_2018_b]; [^Ward_2017_a]).
Working together may confer a shared sense of agency and common purpose, which enhances meaningfulness as well ([^Lysova_et+al_2019_a]).
A related impact on meaningfulness comes from the experience of a shared identity due to identification with co-workers
A related impact on meaningfulness comes from the experience of a shared identity due to identification with co-workers ([^Rosso_et+al_2010_a], p. 111)

### Exercising Skills and Self-development
The idea that the development of skills and talents makes our lives better goes back a long time, with this being one key component of Aristotle’s influential theory of human flourishing ([^Aristotle_2009_a]).
It is no surprise that when contemporary philosophers formulate theories of meaningfulness—and of meaningful work in particular—they tend to include the development and exercise of skills as one of the key components of meaningfulness (e.g., [^Gheaus_2016_a]; [^Roessler_2012_a]; [^Veltman_2016_a])
This idea finds support in the psychological literature.
Humans can flourish and realize their potential
It is not surprising, that exercising and acquiring skills should be widely seen as a key element of meaningful work ([^Hackman_1976_a]; [^Lysova_et+al_2019_a]</a>; [^Rosso_et+al_2010_a]).
Such personal growth or development of oneself enhances the meaningfulness of work ([^Lepisto_2017_a]; [^Martela_2018_b]; [^Steger_et+al_2012_a])

### Self-esteem and Recognition
Work can be a source of self-esteem and social recognition, both of which stimulate the experience of work as meaningful.
When workers acquire and develop skills, when they achieve accomplishments, or make a significant contribution to their organization or society, their experienced self-worth increases.
They evaluate themselves more positively and build self-esteem.
Self-esteem and recognition are widely seen as integral aspects of what can make work meaningful both in the philosophical and psychological literatures on meaningful work ([^Gheaus_2016_a]; [^Montani_et+al_2017_a]</a>; [^Rosso_et+al_2010_a]</a>; [^Tweedie_2010_a]; [^Veltman_2016_a]).
Like the other aspects of meaningful work we identify, those of self-esteem and recognition are widely regarded as key components of good lives more broadly
John Rawls views what he calls Bself-respect^ as being among the so-called Bprimary goods^ that a just society should provide all its citizens with ([^Rawls_1971_a], p. 386). Like the other aspects of meaningful work we identify, those of self-esteem and recognition are widely regarded as key components of good lives more broadly

### Autonomy
The fifth and last constituent of meaningful work we wish to highlight is a set of aspects that we here gather under the umbrella of autonomy.
Others emphasize opportunities to shape one’s work and to make work-related decisions
We view these as being different aspects of what might be called the autonomy that we have at work.
There has been an upsurge in the development of systems endowed with artificial intelligence capable of correctly classifying a certain region on a medical image, e.g., as a benign or malignant tumor
These systems, which employ machine learning techniques, have accuracy rates comparable to, and often higher than, human doctors ([^Esteva_et+al_2017_a]; [^Senders_et+al_2018_a]; [^Wang_et+al_2016_a]).
If human workers understand themselves as teaming up with robots, they may focus on achieving better outcomes together with the robots
This could apply to the medical profession.
We conclude that robots do not necessarily threaten purpose in our work and might very well help us to be even more focused on pursuing purposes in our work

### Robots and Social Relationships
A Threat? It seems safe to assume that robots may significantly change the social dynamics at work, and that they may impact this aspect of work’s meaningfulness.
When Boomer was destroyed in the battlefield, the soldiers even wanted to give Boomer a funeral and military decorations ([^Carpenter_2016_a]</a>; [^Garber_2013_a])
This case helps to illustrate that it is conceivable that robotic co-workers—especially if they have more advanced capabilities for social interaction—may give many human workers a sense of belongingness that fosters experienced meaningfulness ([^Carpenter_2016_a]</a>)..
Imagine that she could team up with some really sophisticated AI, which would give pupils tailored feedback and personalized amounts and types of practice regarding specific mathematical skills, until pupils reach mastery
This teacher could spend considerably more time on her role as a coach by giving individual feedback on the learning-process, by addressing the student’s efforts, motivations, and attitudes.
Similar examples could be worked out for other contexts, such as health-care, given that efficiency gains would be spent on more time to socially interact with colleagues and patients or clients

### Robots and Exercising Skills and Self-development
A Threat? Obviously, if robots take over one or more complex tasks from human workers, several human skills may become obsolete.
The dangers of deskilling due to reliance on automation technology are real and established by research, and apply to robotization as well
Together with such a diminished need to exercise one’s skills, one’s work-related growth and selfdevelopment more generally will probably suffer as a consequence.
Robots might well have the opposite impact by enhancing the need for workers to maintain their skills, and, by requiring them to acquire new and additional complex skills.
To return to our example from above, in order to be able to oversee the performance of machine learning techniques, the radiologists must still master the relevant interpretative skills herself, just as Nissa Scott needed to learn new skills in order to work together with the warehouse robots in her job.
The introduction of robots in the workplace impacts the human development of skills in multiple ways and the overall impact needs to be assessed on a case-to case basis

### Robots and Self-esteem and Recognition
A Threat? It appears to be a real possibility that if robots do the most difficult tasks and humans merely have to operate or supervise robots, human workers may feel less selfworth and have lower self-esteem.
In the long run, surgery robots might make the profession of surgeons more accessible, for instance to persons lacking certain physical abilities necessary for managing surgery instruments.
This could reduce the social recognition surgeons currently receive, as well as the self-esteem of several of them.
It will be evident to parents that the teacher still has all her previous mathematical knowledge and skills, but in addition knows how to successfully employ educational AI, and significantly develops her coaching skills.
Taking into account that collaborating with robots often requires more skills and professional development, workers’ self-esteem and social recognition will often be enhanced

### Robots and Autonomy
A Threat? Some robotic applications in the workplace may require working according to a very strict protocol that leaves little room for human creativity, judgment, and decision-making.
Workers’ opportunities to engage in job crafting may be severely restricted
Their tasks and work environment may be so tightly structured by the robots that there is little room for restructuring in ways that make the job more meaningful.
Robots incorporate artificial intelligence, which often involves machine learning and artificial neural networks
For most people, these AI techniques are hard to understand beyond the surface level and difficult to control and explain to others when needed.
Nissa Scott, the Amazon warehouse employee from our introduction, certainly uses her capacities for understanding, judgment, and decision-making more for overseeing robots than when she stacked plastic bins
Her responsibility and autonomy have increased upon robotization of her workplace.
Our analysis in this paper can serve as a tool for this

### Autonomy
If robots take over many or the most challenging tasks of a job, workers may experience less purposiveness.
If robots take over the most difficult tasks, Teaming up with robots may lead to social recognition and self-esteem may be expanding skills and better outcomes, diminished.
Bpursuing a purpose^ can be reinforced by sharing this sense with a team of co-workers, and interacts with the aspect of Bsocial relationships.^ It is probably less easy to share such a sense of purpose with a robot.
Acquiring complex skills fosters perceived self-efficacy and competence, which can help one to pursue and achieve one's goals in life.
In this way, still more interactions could be pointed out

### Ethical Issues
Recall that some writers argue that society has an obligation to provide its members with opportunities for meaningful work.
That would serve as the basis of substantive meaning-based arguments in favor of, or against, introducing the particular kinds of robots into the given workplaces
This is like adding a theory of substantive value to a consequentialist ethical theory that says that we ought to promote whatever is valuable and counteract whatever has negative value ([^Sinnott-Armstrong_2015_a] section 3).
We ought to view robots as tools and pieces of property, and their design should make this clear
This might be used as an argument against trying to create robots that will replicate aspects of what it is usually associated with being a good colleague.
We should be careful to avoid thinking that ensuring that work in a human–robot workplace is meaningful by the criteria discussed above is sufficient for guaranteeing that there are no ethical issues that can be raised about a workplace living up to those criteria

### Findings
One study shows that combining a human pathologist’s diagnosis with the AI’s classification can lead to an 85% reduction in the error rate compared with the pathologist without the machine

### Concluding Remarks
This paper provides a general framework for how one can discuss the impact of robotization on meaningful work.
In order for this to be investigated more thoroughly, we need to look at the particulars of different types of work and think about what robots in different kinds of workplaces might do with respect to the five aspects of meaningful work discussed above.
We recommend empirical case studies of workplaces where robots are about to be introduced, and of workplaces that already have become robotized, both workplaces being in the same domain.
This will help researchers and policy makers to gain more detailed insights into the impact of robotization on the meaningfulness of work..

## Findings
- One study shows that combining a human pathologist’s diagnosis with the AI’s classification can lead to an 85% reduction in the error rate compared with the pathologist without the machine

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- One study shows that combining a human pathologist’s diagnosis with the AI’s classification can lead to an 85% reduction in the error rate compared with the pathologist without the machine. ==Interestingly, some researchers suggest that this might be due to the human pathologist8 and the AI making different kinds of errors== ([^Wang_et+al_2016_a])
